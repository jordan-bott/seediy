### Today I worked on:

- Today I was finally able to come up with some ideas for a start on a wire frame!
- I also created my database schema ... and 😵‍💫 . I know I should try to cut the project down a bit, but I can't. I want it to do all the things!
- I did decide to officially make the garden layout a stretch goal. I don't have a good idea of how to do it, but I do have the project laid out well to add it (I think)
- Explored [openweatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api), and it has so much! I will be able to use this well for the project and add a lot of things.
- I also found an [API for hardiness zones](https://rapidapi.com/fireside-worldwide-fireside-worldwide-default/api/plant-hardiness-zone). I don't love it, but it will work!
- Found an [icons8 library](https://icons8.com/icon/set/sun/sf-ultralight) I like well for now!

**AH-HA!💡**

- I am really liking using [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/teams/seedify/diagrams/seedify-2), I didn't use a db drawer for Lost Soles, and this makes it look much nicer.

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

- Finally got started on the wire frame and I'm starting to actually make progress!
