## October 15, 2023

### Today I worked on:

- Implementing Oauth2 with JWT and FastAPI
- Made some very small adjustments to the data table

**AH-HA!💡**

- There's a lot of ah-ha here, mostly in reading through the source code for jwtdown-for-fastapi and understanding it!

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

- Initial implementation of auth is done! I'm not sure if it's "right" so I just have to figure that out

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 Token creation wasn't storing the token in the browser

**\~Solution~**

- Added `request.set_cookie()` to my login route

🪲 Logging out wasn't deleting token in the browser

**\~Solution~**

- Added `request.delete_cookie()` to my logout route

🪲 Having a hard time getting the token from the browser to read it for authentication/protection of routes

**\~Solution~**

- Added `request.cookies["fastapi_token"]` to my route that I was wanting to protect.
- This solution does work if I check for the name of the token, but it feels a little weird? There must be a better way.

### Any Blockers:

- Just the question about if I'm protecting endpoints in an okay way, or if I should do something different.

### Tomorrow I'm working on:

- Reading about protecting endpoints
- Write a bunch of backend endpoints
