## October 7, 2023

### Today I worked on:

- Worked on adding api documentation to docs/api.md
- Finished project setup:
  - Updated all dockerfiles
  - Wrote create table migrations
  - Cleaned up `main.py` and file names
  - Created `.env` file w/ signing key

**AH-HA!💡**

It was so nice to have my old journals to find how to create the signing key.

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

Finally making some progress, will be able to code for real this week!

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 psycopg syntax error at or near line 7

**\~Solution~**

This ends up being a syntax error inside of the migration file - there are some clues, but can be tricky to find. It's line 7 _in_ the string, not the whole file
