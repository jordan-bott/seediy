## January 1, 2024

### Today I worked on:

- Moving the project to github, and making sure I can push/pull from the correct repository
- Updating the ReadMe with the current place of the project + the future of the project

**AH-HA!💡**

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**
Finally getting back to work on this project after a long hiatus!

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 Github was pushing with my wrong username (jordan-bott77) even using SSH and updating my username on my computer

**\~Solution~**
Had to run `git config --global user.email` and change to my dev email instead

### References Used Today:

### Any Blockers:

✨None✨

### Next time I'm working on:

- Getting my forms to a good place (cleaner, and displaying the correct info)

### References for The Future:

### Today I worked on:

- Fixing the formatting for the adding a seed form
- Displaying the name of the foreign key in the dropdown rather than the id

**AH-HA!💡**
I don't have to use "event" to update states from forms, and I can pass in a parameter instead!

**🎉 Celebrations 🎉**

- Making progress (even when tired)

### Bugs encountered 🐛🐞🐜 :

🪲 None today 🤞🏼
